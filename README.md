# Community-Cooks
Community Cooks is the project that I implemented as part of my capstone project.

It provides a GUI implementation of a recipe manager that connects to a database. 
The idea came from an ongoing family cookbook that my family puts together and adds to every year.

I have utilized java and sql in this project along with security features like BCrypt password hashing.
